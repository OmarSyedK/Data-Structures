# Data Structures

This repository is a collection of my personal learning and exploration of data structures. You will find various implementations in C, Java, and Python. The aim is to deepen my understanding by coding fundamental and advanced data structures from scratch, experimenting with different approaches, and keeping a record of my progress.

## Overview

- Implementations are organized by topic and language.
- Each file typically contains a single data structure or algorithm
- The repository is continuously updated as I learn new concepts or revisit old ones.

## Possible Topics Included

- Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, BST, AVL, etc.)
- Heaps, Hash Tables
- Graphs and Graph Algorithms
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- And more

> **Note:** This repository is mainly for learning purposes, so it might not be fully comprehensive or ready for production use. Youâ€™ll likely notice some variation in code quality and style as I try out different techniques and approaches.
